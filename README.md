48V IN - 24V @ 5A OUT
This repository features the design of a 120W Synchronous Buck Converter, utilizing MATLAB/Simulink for control verification and Altium Designer for PCB implementation. Currently, the project is under active development, specifically focusing on the finalization of the PCB routing stage. Future updates will include the completed layout, Gerber files for manufacturing, and prototype test results.
