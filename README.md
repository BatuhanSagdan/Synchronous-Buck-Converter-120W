48V IN - 24V @ 5A OUT <br>
This repository features the design of a 120W Synchronous Buck Converter, utilizing MATLAB/Simulink for control verification and Altium Designer for PCB implementation. Currently, the project is under active development. Following the PCB finalization, CC-CV mode with PI control using an STM32 will be implemented. Future updates will include the completed layout, Gerber files for manufacturing, and prototype test results.  <br>
